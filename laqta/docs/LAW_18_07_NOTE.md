# Law 18-07 Compliance - Important Note

This is a significant feature that impacts multiple areas of the website (all forms, cookie handling, tracking scripts, translations in 3 languages, and CMS content structure).

Ideally, Law 18-07 compliance should have been discussed with the designer and planned from the beginning of the project. Implementing it retroactively introduces several challenges:

- Modifying existing forms that were already designed and approved
- Adding UI elements (checkboxes, info boxes) that may not fit the original design
- Ensuring consistent styling across all affected components
- Testing all forms again after modifications
- Coordinating translation updates across all languages
- Risk of breaking existing functionality

For future projects, legal compliance requirements (GDPR, Law 18-07, etc.) should be part of the initial planning phase alongside the designer to ensure proper UX integration from the start.
